DO-MPC proposes a new, modularized implementation and testing support for optimal control schemes based on  MPC approaches. The goal of this software project is to offer a simple to use and efficient platform, that allows users to define and test their  problems very fast and trouble-free. In most cases, such implementations are highly complex and cumbersome, requiring considerable coding effort that only produces hardcoded solutions for each individual test case. With DO-MPC we propose a generalized approach based on simple templates  that can be edited for each individual problem. A robust and time efficient core module combines everything together automatically, such that the coding effort is reduced drastically. Taking advantage of state of the art third party software, DO-MPC  is able to handle a wide variety of problems, making even large systems real time feasible.

Moreover, DO-MPC provides a very simple framework for the implementation of a state-of-the art robust nonlinear model predictive control approach called multi-stage NMPC, which is based on the description of the uncertainty as a scenario tree.

The DO-MPC software is Python based and works therefore on any OS with a Python 2.7 distribution. DO-MPC has been developed at the DYN chair by Sergio Lucia and Alexandru Tatulea.
