# DO-MPC
DO-MPC proposes a new, modularized implementation and testing support for optimal control schemes based on  MPC approaches. The goal of this software project is to offer a simple to use and efficient platform, that allows users to define and test their  problems very fast and trouble-free. In most cases, such implementations are highly complex and cumbersome, requiring considerable coding effort that only produces hardcoded solutions for each individual test case. With DO-MPC we propose a generalized approach based on simple templates  that can be edited for each individual problem. A robust and time efficient core module combines everything together automatically, such that the coding effort is reduced drastically. Taking advantage of state of the art third party software, DO-MPC  is able to handle a wide variety of problems, making even large systems real time feasible.

The DO-MPC software is Python based and works therefore on any OS with a Python 2.7 distribution. DO-MPC has been developed at the DYN chair by Sergio Lucia, Alexandru Tatulea and Sebastian Engell and it can be downloaded FREE here. Please check this page for further information and example code from the developers.
